# 🧪 silicon-doping-simulator

A real-time semiconductor doping simulator built using **Python**, **PyQt5**, and **Matplotlib**.  
It supports both **N-type** and **P-type** doping and is tailored for researchers and professionals in:

- Semiconductor physics
- Nanotechnology
- Electronic materials

## 🔬 Features

- Real-time conductivity/resistivity calculation
- Temperature-dependent modeling
- Supports advanced mobility models (Caughey-Thomas)
- Band gap narrowing at high doping
- Incomplete ionization of dopants
- Electron/hole scattering effects
- Logging, CSV export, and 2D plotting
- UI separation using `SiliconDopingModel` class
